# MachineLearningStocks
Using python to make stock predictions

MachineLearningStocks is designed to be an intuitive and highly extensible template project applying machine learning to making stock predictions. My hope is that this project will help you understand the overall workflow of using machine learning to predict stock movements and also appreciate some of its subtleties. And of course, after following this guide and playing around with the project, you should definitely make your own improvements.
